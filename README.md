Calculator Command line Task in Python

Description of the project:

Function Definitions: The project defines four functions (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.

Calculator Function: The calculator() function serves as the main function of the program. It displays a welcome message and prompts the user to select an operation. Then it takes input for two numbers. Depending on the selected operation, it calls the appropriate function and displays the result.

User Interaction: The user interacts with the calculator by inputting their choice of operation and the two numbers they want to perform the operation on.

Error Handling: The program checks for division by zero and handles it appropriately by displaying an error message.

This is a simple command-line calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations easily.
